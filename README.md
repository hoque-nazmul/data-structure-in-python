### List (Mutable)
Python's list are implemented as dynamic arrays behind the scenes.
Arrays store information in adjoining blocks of memory.
Python List cab be hold arbitrary elements.
It's very fast (O(1) -> Constant Time) for accessing, updating, adding (Only in the last position) and removing (Only in the last position) data. 
But It's not a good choice for adding & removing data except in the last position of list. We can use deque for that.
>Useful Methods: index()/count()/append()/pop()/pop(index)/insert()/remove()/clear()/sort()/reverse()/extend()/copy()
> [1,2,3,4,5]

#### List Comprehension
```python
li = [1,2,3,4,5]
bigger = [num for num in li if num > 3]
# Output: [4,5]
```
#### List as Stack
Supports append and pop operations in O(1) time
```python
user = []
# Insert user in the Last of List
user.append('John')
user.append('Justin')
user.append('Foo')
print(user) # ['John', 'Justin', 'Foo']

# Remove user from the Last of List
user.pop()
print(user) # ['John', 'Justin']
user.pop()
print(user) # ['John']
```
#### List as Queue
Supports append and pop operations in O(n) time. We can optimized the performance using deque data structure.
```python
user = []
# Insert user in the Last of List
user.append('John')
user.append('Justin')
user.append('Foo')
print(user) # ['John', 'Justin', 'Foo']

# Remove user from the first of List
user.pop(0)
print(user) # ['Justin', 'Foo']
user.pop(0)
print(user) # ['Foo']
```
